You are not bad at something.

You are new at it.

But what I’m proposing is that you are not only new at the activity or skill that you are trying to master.

You are new at the skill of consistency.

Before focusing on how to be better at something, you need to focus on being able to be consistent with anything.

Hopefully you realize by now that this is not a post about physical training specifically.

It’s just that people like burpees and six packs.

Consistency is a skill that can be developed and applied to any aspect of your life.

I am inviting you to join the Consistency Challenge inside the Sisyphus Society and develop 1-3 rock-solid habits with the rest of us.

Besides the Consistency Challenge, by joining the Sisyphus Society you get access to:

“The Lost Art of Reading” guide.

Daily Struggle training programs.

Members-only Existential Espresso essays.

Q&As.

And a community of awesome individuals...

You can join via link in the bio.

There is little over 24 hours left for the enrollment.

Next enrollment will be somewhere in 2023.
